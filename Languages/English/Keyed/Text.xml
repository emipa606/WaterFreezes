  <WFM.tickInfo>Ticks Per Simulation Update
The higher this is the less frequently it will update, the less realistic it will be, and the less it will impact TPS.
500 minimum, it's indistinguishable from updating every tick quality-wise but way better performance.
Anything higher than 2500 (1 in-game hour) has not been tested. Default is 1000 for a good balance.
Versions before this setting was introduced had it set to 2500.</WFM.tickInfo>
  <WFM.multiplierInfo>Take care when modifying the multiplier and divisor, relatively small changes will produce big effects!
The temperature is multiplied by this value before going into other calculations to produce the amount of freezing that occurs below freezing.</WFM.multiplierInfo>
